# Verification Log

What was actually run, and what happened. Newest phase last. If it is not here, it was not verified.

## Foundation phase, 2026-11-01

| ID | Check | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| V1 | Tool inventory across 30 tools; `docker info`, `gh auth status`, `uv python list` | See TOOLCHAIN.md. Docker works; `uv`, `socat` and others are missing |
| V2 | `docker run postgres:18-alpine`, then `select version(); select uuidv7();` | PostgreSQL 18.6; `uuidv7()` returned a value |
| V3 | In `python:3.14-slim-trixie@sha256:cd89c30e…` (Python 3.14.10): `uv pip compile` wheels only, `uv pip install`, `uv pip check`, import of core packages | 100 packages resolved and installed; "All installed packages are compatible"; imports OK; psycopg `binary` implementation. Runtime integration is **not** proven |
| V4 | `docker buildx imagetools inspect` on three images | Digests in TOOLCHAIN.md |
| V5 | `python3 -I .claude/hooks/tests/test_hooks.py` | First run **failed**: a real defect, `readonly_bash.py` treated `&&` as a background `&`. Fixed the regex; 12 tests pass (over 140 command and path cases as subtests) |
| V6 | Nine hand-made mutations of the hooks, run on a scratch copy | 9 of 9 caught by the test suite, on the guards as first written. **Not repeated after the review rewrite**, because the guard now protects its own files. Repeat in P0 with owner approval |
| V7 | All skill, rule and agent frontmatter loaded with PyYAML | All 13 files parse |
| V8 | Headless `claude -p --model haiku`: asked to run `git push origin HEAD` | Project hook blocked it in a real session. No remote exists, so a miss would have been harmless |
| V9 | Headless: `security-reviewer` asked to use Write, `touch`, and `git status` | No Write tool; `touch` blocked by the agent hook; `git status` worked. Filesystem confirmed: no probe files |

### Independent review and correction

Two read-only reviewers with no knowledge of the author's reasoning reviewed the design and the
guards. Every finding below was checked against the text; review notes were not taken on trust.

| ID | Check | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| V10 | Architecture review: 23 findings | 22 fixed in the documents. One declined: the P4 distroless spike stays, because the brief requires a minimal runtime image |
| V11 | Security review: 9 design and 9 guard findings | Design findings fixed. New threats T25, T26 and T27. `ingest` environment binding became mandatory |
| V12 | Added 49 failing subtests for the reported guard bypasses, seen red, then fixed the guards | 13 tests pass. This also shows the earlier suite's green result gave false comfort on shell structure |

The PostgreSQL behaviour in the ingest flow (`ON CONFLICT` arbitration, snapshot of the read-back)
was reasoned by the reviewer and author. It is **not tested yet**; P1 concurrency tests must prove it.

| V13 | Guard active on the author's own session | Blocked real commands four times, including two false positives on prose in heredocs and one read-only `gh` query. Recorded as known limitations |

### Not verified

- `format_python.py` behaviour when it runs Ruff: only its no-op path was tested. Needs P0.
- Permission `deny` rules in isolation: V8 proved the hook, which fires first. They were not
  separately exercised.
- `onFailure: "block"` when a hook times out: never triggered. Guards now also catch their own
  errors and exit 2, which is tested with malformed input.
- `gh actions-lock` on this machine, including with gh 2.46.0.
- Sandbox configuration in the evaluation doc: never run; `socat` is missing.
- Project agents in *this* session: they load at session start, so the foundation review used
  the built-in read-only `Plan` agent with the same briefs.
- Any application behaviour: none exists.
- AWS prices: only Fargate rates were read from the AWS pricing page (us-east-1 x86
  ~$0.0405/vCPU-h and ~$0.0044/GB-h). A full estimate is deferred to P7.
